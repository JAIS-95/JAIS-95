##
* My work sits at the intersection of **genomics**, **machine learning**, and **bioinformatics**, where I develop scalable pipelines, predictive models, and tools to accelerate scientific research.
* Currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the **Antimicrobial Discovery Center, Northeastern University**, where I work with NGS data, protein language models, and machine learning pipelines for biosynthetic gene cluster and target prediction and metagenomic analysis.
